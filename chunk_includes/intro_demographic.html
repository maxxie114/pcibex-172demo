    <b>Instructions</b>
    
    <br>
    This experiment is being conducted by Syntax, Semantics, and Language Processing Lab (s/lab) at UC Santa Cruz. In this experiment, you will be reading sentences one word at a time by pressing the space bar. Please read carefully and at a pace that feels natural to you so that you are understanding everything. You will have a chance to go through some practice items before the experiment begins to get used to reading sentences in this way.
    <br><br>
    After each sentence, you will be asked a question about what you just read, so make sure you are paying attention! You can respond to the questions by pressing the "F" and "J" keys. Press "F" to respond "Yes" and "J" to respond "No."
    <br><br>
    As you move through the experiment, please keep your thumbs resting on the space bar. Please do not take a break in the middle of a sentence. You may take breaks in between sentences, but make sure you have not started pressing through a sentence first.
